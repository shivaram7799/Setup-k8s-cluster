Installing Kubernetes on AWS using Kops
1. Launch Linux EC2 instance in AWS, we will use this EC2 instance to launch
our Kubernetes cluster by installing Kops on it. I will launch this instance in Ohio region but you can pick any region of your choice

2. Create and attach IAM role to EC2 Instance.
Kops would need permissions following permissions in order to operate:
	S3
	EC2
	VPC
	Route53
	Autoscaling
	etc..
	
Create a Role for the above specified permissions and then attach it to the running EC2 instance

### 3. Install Kops on EC2
curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops
4. Install kubectl
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
5. Create S3 bucket in AWS
S3 bucket is used by kubernetes to persist cluster state and so, create any S3 bucket of your choice

simplilearn.k8s

6. Create private hosted zone in AWS Route53
Head over to aws Route53 and create a private hosted zone
Choose a name of your choice - simplilearn.in
Choose type as private hosted zone for VPC
Select default vpc in the region you are setting up your cluster
7 Configure environment variables.
Open .bashrc file

	vi ~/.bashrc
Add following content into .bashrc, you can choose any arbitary name for cluster and make sure buck name matches the one you created in previous step.

export KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME=simplilearn.in
export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://simplilearn.in.k8s
Then running command to reflect variables added to .bashrc

	source ~/.bashrc
8. Create ssh key pair
This keypair is used for ssh into kubernetes cluster

ssh-keygen
9. Create a Kubernetes cluster definition.
kops create cluster \
--state=${KOPS_STATE_STORE} \
--node-count=2 \
--master-size=t2.micro \
--node-size=t2.micro \
--zones=us-east-2a,us-east-2b \
--name=${KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME} \
--dns private \
--master-count 1
10. Create kubernetes cluster
kops update cluster --yes
Above command may take some time to create the required infrastructure resources on AWS. Execute the validate command to check its status and wait until the cluster becomes ready

kops validate cluster
For the above above command, you might see validation failed error initially when you create cluster and it is expected behaviour, you have to wait for some more time and check again.

11. To connect to the master
ssh admin@api.simplilearn.in
Destroy the kubernetes cluster
kops delete cluster  --ye
